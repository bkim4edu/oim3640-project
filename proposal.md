# The Big Idea

The main idea of our project is we want to create a blackjack game in python where the user can input their decisions. Weâ€™ll explore the topics of creating a web app with flask and object-oriented programming from in-class. Our minimum viable product is a simple text interface that takes user input and prints the results of the card game, while our stretch goal is to make a web app for the user to play the game through.

# Learning Goals

Our team learning goal is to be able to understand and code this blackjack game. We feel like this could be an interesting and intellectually challenging assignment, and would want to invest time and effort into it. We also want to be able to understand the topics required to achieve this program in greater detail. Coding aside, we would also like to develop our teamwork and communication abilities throughout the project.

# Implementation Plan

We will start by writing the code for the card game itself, which involves writing code to represent cards, a deck of cards, and the logic for the blackjack game. Then, create a way to interact with the code either through a text-based interface or a web app with a more involved GUI.

# Project Schedule

Within the first two weeks, we plan to study the related modules and content required to develop this project. Then, from weeks three to four, we plan on implementing some of that knowledge and see how far we can develop our program. During this time, we will also be researching for additional resources that could help with our project. By week six, we hope to achieve a working prototype - one that may be simple but working. From then to the end of the project, we hope to continuously improve our program to become more sophisticated and more user friendly.

* Week 1-2:   Flesh out plans for the project. Finish framing/agenda setting and  reflection/synthesis document due for the design review. We will also study related modules.

* Weeks 3-4:  Implementing knowledge and developing our program. We will also be researching for additional resources as well.

* Week 5-6:   At this stage, we hope to accomplish a working prototype that is simple.

* Week 7-8:   Continually develop our program to become more advanced and more user-friendly.

# Collaboration plan

For our research, we believe that we could research separately and brainstorm the ideas that we have together. However, once we start implementing and coding, we plan to meet physically to work on the code together. Certainly, there may be tasks that we have to split up; however, as our previous assignment has turned out so well from us working together, we believe we will primarily be working together in that format. In order to work together as a team well, we must learn to be respectful of each other, including learning to disagree respectfully. We will also listen to ideas with an open mind before making any decisions. Furthermore, we also agree to finish the work to the best of our ability, to ensure the quality of our work is high.

# Risks

Writing the actual logic and code for the blackjack game should be a relatively straightforward process, but how we choose to display it to the user might be trickier. Our two ideas are a simple command line-style output where the user simply inputs their play, or a webapp with a more interactive GUI for the user. Of these, the webapp would be the ideal implementation but would be the more advanced implementation of the two.

# Additional Course Content

The classes on object-oriented programming should be helpful as classes and objects can be used to represent card attributes like suits and values to represent a deck of playing cards.
